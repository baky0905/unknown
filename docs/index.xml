      <description>Motivation Since my main focus here is to learn basics of friendly regular expressions {rex} and processing raw text from emails in a tidy fashion, I will completly neglect any available packages that deal with email data processing like for example REmail.
Secondly, when I first opened the following tutorial where they introduced Python Regex for data scientists applied on the same dataset of Fraudulent Email Corpus from Kaggle, it was a bit intimidating on how much looping and control flowing, unfriendly regular expressions were happening within.</description>

“Visualization can surprise, but it doesn’t scale. Modeling scales well, but it can’t fundamentally surprise.” – Hadley Wickham.
One of the most important phases in the Data Analysis process is data visualization. It is an inherently human activity which relies on our ability to comprehend visual information and make sense of patterns. However, there’s only so much we can spend in visualizing the data, and regardless how many hours we may decide to put into it, it is never going to be enough.</description>
