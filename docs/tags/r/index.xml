      <description>Motivation
Since my main focus here is to learn basics of friendly regular expressions {rex} and processing raw text from emails in a tidy fashion, I will completly neglect any available packages that deal with email data processing like for example REmail.
Secondly, when I first opened the following tutorial where they introduced Python Regex for data scientists applied on the same dataset of Fraudulent Email Corpus from Kaggle, it was a bit intimidating on how much looping and control flowing, unfriendly regular expressions were happening within.</description>
